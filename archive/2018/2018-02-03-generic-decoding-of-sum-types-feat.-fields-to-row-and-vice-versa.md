# Generic Decoding of Sum Types Feat. Fields to Row and vice versa

## Update

As of PureScript 0.12, Generics-Rep does not derive or use `Record` and `Field` for records. So a lot of the hacks here for how to work with Record types can be safely ignored now, but you might find them useful as more demonstrations of how to do some type-level programming to get types you want.
